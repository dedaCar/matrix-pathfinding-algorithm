# matrix-pathfinding-algorithm
Implemented pathfinding algorithm through matrix with random generated obstacles.
Find shortest path through 10*10 matrix with random generated obstacles. We have predefined start coordinates and end coordinates. Random generated obstacles CANNOT completely block the path, there allways have to be at least one route from start to finish.
